Log into CANVAS -> Quantitative Business Analysis -> Modules   ->   AssignmentsDownload   the   dataset   posted   under   the   Assignments   Module   on   Canvas.   Answer   the   questions   below. Use Excel tools and functions. If   you need   to provide any explanations (text), you can type   the    text in the textbox. To receive credit for the assignment, submit your answers under   Homework01   (quiz   format)   and   upload   the   excel   file   showing   your   work.   All   statistics   must   be   computed with excel (any statistics computed by other means   and   simply typed into the   excel   file   will not be accepted.)
1.       Identify one variable as   an explanatory variable and   another   as   a response variable.
2.       How many observations are in the dataset?
3.       Make a well-labeled scatterplot.4.       Comment on the form, direction, and the   strength   of   the   association.
5.       Superimpose the regression line on the scatter plot,   display the   equation   and R-squared.
6.       Use Data Analysis to generate the REGRESSION output.
7.       Determine the correlation   coefficient.
8.       Explain the meaning of   the regression coefficients (the slope and   the   y-intercept).
9.       Report the total sum of   squared residuals.
10. Report the standard error of   estimate and   explain   its meaning.
11. Compute the coefficient of   determination (R-squared)   and   explain its meaning.
